# IWP
wp = weakest precondition. Main file is wp_inter.py
experiment = hyperopt experiment and json_printer

(to be edited)

# Note
Might want to skip some files and directories (testing suits, etc)

    in REF_crawler.py
        - get_function_map(...)



# TODO
A sub-tool for call graph only (in call_graph.py)
